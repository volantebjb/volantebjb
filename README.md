# About Me

Recently graduated in Computer Engineering from the Technological Institute of the Philippines, I demonstrated proficiency in networking and cybersecurity, and contributed to practical AI and IoT projects. This includes developing a small vessel emergency alert system and a chatbot app with sentiment analysis.

During my internship as a Data Analyst at Analog Devices, Inc., a Fortune 500 company, I addressed BU-level challenges by designing real-time PowerBI dashboards and automating ETL processes to enhance operational efficiency.

Beyond studies and work, I'm involved as an AWS re/Start Trainee, Microsoft Learn Beta Student Ambassador, and Cisco Insider Advocateâ€”sharing knowledge, learning collaboratively, and contributing to industry growth.

Additionally, I am currently enrolled in the AWS re/Start program, actively enhancing my cloud computing skills through labs and projects. Concurrently, I am obtaining certifications from Alibaba Cloud and OCI to broaden my expertise, with the goal of achieving AWS and Azure certifications by December. I am eager to apply my theoretical knowledge to practical solutions.
